## Project
Astrologer AI Agent with RAG — Vedic astrology + palmistry PDFs → OCR → embed → ChromaDB → LLM Q&A agent.

## Current Session Focus
**Session 16 COMPLETE.** Palm geometry validation consolidated into validate_palm_image()'s single GPT-4o call — quality/issues still drive hard_reject/warn; palm_facing/finger_direction (+ issues) now also produce geometry_tips, no extra call. Hand-laterality detection removed entirely — replaced with upload-time human confirmation + swap (regenerates description on swap). Chat UI: fixed unformatted-answer bug (st.write_stream → st.markdown) and question-disappear-on-submit bug (render order). 35/35 non-integration passing.
<!-- UPDATE THIS every session. One line only. -->

## Locked Decisions
- **Hand-laterality via vision LLM** — evaluated across Sessions 15-16 under 3 framings (anchored chirality, unanchored chirality, thumb-side spatial position); consistently unreliable (Session 15: 5/6 right-bias on unlabeled images; Session 16: 3/4 thumb-side accuracy on N=4, one image misjudged, sample too small to trust). Permanent design: human confirmation at upload, no GPT laterality judgment.

## Windows Paths (hardcoded)
- Tesseract: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
- Poppler: `C:\Program Files\poppler-26.02.0\Library\bin`

## Module Order
```
pdf_processor → image_extractor → chunker → translator → embedder → ChromaDB
query_engine + chart_calculator → astrologer → session_manager
```

## Chunk Metadata Schema (locked — do not alter)
```python
{
  "chunk_id": str,       # "{book_name}_p{page_num}_c{index}"
  "text": str,
  "topic": str,
  "language": "eng|hin|mixed",
  "page_ref": int,
  "image_path": "str|null",
  "book_name": str,
  "page_type": "text|diagram|mixed",
  "word_count": int,
}
```
Sub-chunks always have `_c{index}` appended to `chunk_id`.

## Working Style (non-negotiable)
1. **REVIEW before PROCEED** — flag at least one issue before approving any edit
2. **SAMPLE before SCALE** — propose sample validation before full dataset runs
3. **HARDEST CASE first** — test on edge cases, not simple ones
4. **THRESHOLD DISCIPLINE** — every numeric threshold needs justification + scope guard + tuning note
5. **AI reviewing AI** — flag when output has no human review; never chain AI decisions without human checkpoint
6. **SURGICAL EDITS** — no full file rewrites; Python 3.11; always `try/except` with meaningful errors
7. **AGENT INVOCATION** — auto-invoke all 6 before any design/code decision. Surface conflicts only. New agents need explicit approval.
8. **LAYER FIRST** — before any fix, state which layer owns the problem: Data, Retrieval, Prompt, or UI. A fix in the wrong layer creates narrow patches and technical debt.
9. **NO ANCHORED JUDGMENT** — never give an LLM call both a stated expectation and a request to judge against it in the same call. LLM observes independently (no expectation context given); Python compares the observation to the expectation deterministically.
