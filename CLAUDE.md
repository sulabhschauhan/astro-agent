## Project
Astrologer AI Agent with RAG — Vedic astrology + palmistry PDFs → OCR → embed → ChromaDB → LLM Q&A agent.

## Current Session Focus
**P2.5 Shadbala CLOSED (Session 38, 2026-06-30). 153 new tests, 1380 passed total. Drik Bala stubbed V1 (see Known Source Divergences). Next: Phase 1 Bhava Bala + Ishta/Kashta, then thin-slice answer pipeline checkpoint (see Session 31 key decisions).**
<!-- UPDATE THIS every session. One line only. -->

## Locked Decisions
- **Hand-laterality via vision LLM** — evaluated Sessions 15-16 under 3 framings; consistently unreliable (worst case 5/6 right-bias on unlabeled images). Permanent: human confirmation at upload, no GPT laterality judgment.
- **Tiebreaker principle (memory #10)** — when classical sources are genuinely fragmented, user-perceived correctness wins over single-source purity. Locked via the Rahu/Ketu graha drishti decision (Session 19); applies to all contested P2-P7 decisions, including roadmap sequencing.
- **No Chart dataclass / VargaType enum** (Session 20) — neither exists; Navamsa built as a pure `(jd_ut, asc_lon_sidereal)` function instead. Revisit only when a varga module genuinely needs shared chart-identity state.
- **Reference-chart fixture template** (Session 20) — one standalone test per chart, not `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, when expected-value structures differ; delete skip-stub parametrize blocks once empty.
- **Transit fixture anchor** (Session 21, PROVISIONAL) — 18:30 UTC (00:00 IST next day); needs second-date corroboration before treating as final.
- **P2 order** (locked Session 20, PAUSED Session 22, UNPAUSED Session 23) — Gochara → Sade Sati → Muhurta engine (Chandrabala instant primitive + range-scan shipped Session 24; Tarabala, Panchaka next — sub-step numbering needs reconciling, see SESSION_LOG) → Ashtakoot/Mangal dosha → Shadbala → D7 → D10 (demoted); P3+ deferred.
- **V1 scope** — LLM-generated interpretive Q&A is OUT (see `diagnostics/path_c_validation_20260621_173724.md`, Session 23 close 2026-06-21). AstroSage paragraph terminal; palm primary; deterministic calculation-engine output is V1's only structured Q&A surface.
- **Bisection-over-discrete-state range-scan** (Session 24) — locked pattern for all transit-range-scan modules, NOT fixed-step. Internal-only constants: 0.5 JD coarse step, 1e-6 JD bisection precision, max_iters=40; no caller-facing precision params. Threshold-discipline rejects tunable step params without a classical anchor; empirically, bisection vs. a naive 12h grid differs by 8-11h per Moon ingress (P2.3.2 Fixture 1 epistemic check).
- **Per-module ephemeris helpers stay duplicated** (Session 24) — `_moon_sign`/`_moon_nakshatra`/`_saturn_sign` etc. are not cross-imported between transit modules; `helpers/ephemeris.py` extraction (still a stub, Session 19+) remains the agreed future remediation.
- **Per-module bisection helper stays duplicated** (Session 24) — `_bisect_transition` is reimplemented per module (chandrabala.py, tarabala.py), not imported between them. Extract to `helpers/` once a third module carries it.
- **Sign convention split, transits** (Session 19-24) — `gochara.py` uses 1-12 (1=Aries); `sade_sati.py`/`chandrabala.py` use 0-11 (0=Aries); `tarabala.py` uses 0-26 (0=Ashwini) for nakshatras. `gochara.py` normalization remains an unscheduled backlog item.
- **Binary FAVORABLE/UNFAVORABLE across Muhurta limbs** (Session 24) — Chandrabala and Tarabala both lock binary categories; NEUTRAL classifications (2nd/5th-house Chandrabala, activity-dependent Janma Tara) are deferred jointly to V1.1.
- **PVR source-ladder asymmetry, Chandrabala vs. Tarabala** (Session 24) — Chandrabala lives in PVR's transit chapter (Ch.26 Table 63), not his Muhurta chapter; Tarabala lives directly in PVR's own Muhurta chapter (Ch.36 §36.3). Both still bind their FAVORABLE/UNFAVORABLE enums from mainstream Muhurta lineage, not derived purely from PVR.
- **Transit range-scan test layout** (Session 24) — `test_<module>.py` (instant) + `test_<module>_windows.py` (range-scan), both under `tests/calculations/transits/`.
- **Panchaka V1 = Definition B** (Session 25) — Moon sidereal longitude in [300, 360) degrees (Aquarius + Pisces). Binary IS_PANCHAK / NOT_PANCHAK only.
- **Panchaka Definition A deferred** (Session 25) — nakshatra-pada-exact start (~293°20', Dhanishtha's 3rd pada) deferred to V1.1 as a round-degree simplification; the ~6°40' gap vs. Definition B is documented in `panchaka.py`'s docstring as risk-accepted, not reconciled.
- **Panchaka named-type overlay deferred** (Session 25) — Raj/Agni/Chor/Mrityu/Rog Panchak classification by entry weekday deferred to V1.1; requires a Panchak-entry-vara backward scan plus a location/timezone dependency, out of scope for V1's binary surface.
- **Panchaka Rahita is a separate concept** (Session 25) — the Andhra/Telangana intraday Muhurta system (function of Tithi+Vara+Nakshatra+Lagna) is NOT a Panchaka extension; documented as a future standalone `panchaka_rahita.py` module, not folded into `panchaka.py`.
- **Panchaka source** (Session 25) — Definition B and the three V1.1 deferrals above sourced from Muhurtha-Chinthamani p.84-85; verified this session against the project's own RAG corpus (`data/all_chunks.json`, OCR'd from `data/pdfs/Muhurtha-Chinthamani.pdf`), not a fresh direct PDF read.
- **Design-proposal-first is not default** (Session 25) — earn a pre-implementation design-proposal pass only when (a) classical sources are genuinely ambiguous post-agent-pass, (b) the module structurally differs from existing precedent, (c) fixtures require pre-implementation ephemeris computation, or (d) the API shape is uncertain; default to a direct implementation prompt.

## Windows Paths (hardcoded)
- Tesseract: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
- Poppler: `C:\Program Files\poppler-26.02.0\Library\bin`

## Module Order
```
pdf_processor → image_extractor → chunker → translator → embedder → ChromaDB
query_engine + chart_calculator → astrologer → session_manager
```

## Chunk Metadata Schema (locked — do not alter)
```python
{
  "chunk_id": str,       # "{book_name}_p{page_num}_c{index}"
  "text": str,
  "topic": str,
  "language": "eng|hin|mixed",
  "page_ref": int,
  "image_path": "str|null",
  "book_name": str,
  "page_type": "text|diagram|mixed",
  "word_count": int,
  "text_sha256": str,    # SHA-256 hex digest of `text`; embedder-computed, ChromaDB-metadata-only (not chunker-emitted)
}
```
Sub-chunks always have `_c{index}` appended to `chunk_id`.
Schema lock permits additive fields with safe defaults; renames and removals require explicit sign-off. `text_sha256` added per `diagnostics/embedder_hardening_proposal_20260621_100850.md`.

## Working Style (non-negotiable)
1. **REVIEW before PROCEED** — flag at least one issue before approving any edit
2. **SAMPLE before SCALE** — propose sample validation before full dataset runs
3. **HARDEST CASE first** — test on edge cases, not simple ones
4. **THRESHOLD DISCIPLINE** — every numeric threshold needs justification + scope guard + tuning note
5. **AI reviewing AI** — flag when output has no human review; never chain AI decisions without human checkpoint
6. **SURGICAL EDITS** — no full file rewrites; Python 3.11; always `try/except` with meaningful errors
7. **AGENT INVOCATION** — auto-invoke all 6 before any design/code decision. Surface conflicts only. New agents need explicit approval.
8. **LAYER FIRST** — before any fix, state which layer owns the problem: Data, Retrieval, Prompt, or UI. A fix in the wrong layer creates narrow patches and technical debt.
9. **NO ANCHORED JUDGMENT** — never give an LLM call both a stated expectation and a request to judge against it in the same call. LLM observes independently; Python compares the observation to the expectation deterministically.

## Varshaphal House-Counting Convention (Session 18)
`resolve_house_counting_lagna()` is the canonical house-counting reference for any Varshaphal-derived bhav calculation (prefers AstroSage parsed Lagna, year-matched; else computed + boundary flag); call it rather than reading Lagna directly off `varshaphal_data`.

## Calculation Architecture (Session 19+)
Every new calculation module lives in its `calculations/` subpackage; never add calculation logic to a top-level file.

**Package structure:** `core/` (chart_d1, panchanga, aspects, dignity) · `vargas/` (D2-D60, vimshopaka) · `strength/` (shadbala, ishta_kashta, bhava_bala) · `dashas/` (vimshottari, yogini, chara, ashtottari, mudda) · `yogas/` (detector + catalog/) · `transits/` (gochara, sade_sati, chandrabala, transit_aspects) · `ashtakavarga/` (bav, sav) · `jaimini/` (karakas, arudha, padas) · `annual/` (varshaphal, muntha, sahams) · `helpers/` (house_counting, ephemeris)
**Canonical helpers:** `resolve_house_counting_lagna()` (`helpers/house_counting.py`) — canonical for ANY Varshaphal-derived bhav calc; `helpers/ephemeris.py` — planned pyswisseph wrapper, currently a stub (interim: direct `swe.calc_ut` + a `# TODO` marker per call site).
**Validation protocol** (per module, on top of Working Style #2/#3): empirical validation across 4 reference charts before locking a formula; zero free parameters (test alternative hypotheses, rule them out); AstroSage parity where applicable, JHora oracle where not; document irreducible cross-software noise as discovered.

## Reference Materials
**Calculation specifications:** `project_files/classical_references/PVR_Vedic_Astrology_Integrated_Approach.pdf` — primary reference for P1-P6; PVR authored both this book and JHora (book = formulas/justification, JHora = numerical ground truth); both consulted before implementing any new calculation module.
**Validation oracles:** AstroSage PDFs (4 reference charts) for secondary parity; JHora exports as primary parity where AstroSage doesn't expose the calculation.
**Interpretive RAG (separate, do not pollute):** ChromaDB ~7,281 chunks across 14 classical texts, for Tier 4 interpretive answers in Parashara's voice. Modern textbooks (incl. PVR's) are deliberately excluded from RAG to preserve classical voice and avoid single-author bias.

## Known Source Divergences — locked V1

### Shadbala Saptavargaja Bala scoring
- **Spec source:** BPHS 27.2-4 literal (Mooltrikona=45, Own=30, Pramudita=20, Shanta=15, Din=10, Duhkhita=4, Khala=2)
- **AstroSage delta:** AstroSage uses an unpublished scoring table that produces totals 10-30 Virupa higher per planet. Reverse-engineering from public data is not reliably possible — Sun fits Adhimitra=30/Sama=7.5 but Moon does not fit the same table.
- **User impact:** Near-zero in V1. Shadbala feeds Yoga detection (P3) and Trigger Naming (P7), both of which consume RANKING, not absolute values. Ranking is stable across BPHS vs AstroSage scoring tables for the dominant components (Sthana base + Kala + Chesta).
- **Revisit trigger:** Phase A user testing surfacing a ranking complaint that traces to Saptavargaja precision.

### Shadbala Drekkana Bala
- **Spec source:** AstroSage + JHora convergence on 1 Virupa flat constant for all planets (three-tier hierarchy rule).
- **BPHS divergence:** BPHS 27.6 specifies 15/0 binary by gender×decanate. Locked at 1 Virupa per AstroSage parity.

### Ayana Bala — Moon/Venus high-declination edge case (V1 accepted gap)
- **Spec source:** PyJHora `(24.0 + adj_decl) * 1.25` formula.
- **Validation oracle:** AstroSage Kundli PDFs (4 charts).
- **Pass tolerance:** ±2.0 Virupa for 5/7 planets; ±6.0 Virupa for Moon and Venus.
- **Delta magnitude:** Moon and Venus at near-maximum declination (≈23.8°) compute to ~59.7 and ~59.9 respectively; AstroSage shows 54.45 and 56.21. Other 5 planets (Sun, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn) match within ±2.
- **User impact:** Moon Shadbala total delta ~1.1% (5.27 of 483.91). Negligible for Shadbala threshold checks (min_required=6.0 Rupa, computed ~8.07, delta does not change strong/weak classification).
- **Revisit trigger:** If user testing surfaces complaints about Moon/Venus Shadbala values being off, investigate AstroSage's exact Ayana algorithm by reverse-engineering against a chart with Moon/Venus at moderate declination (≈10°) where the formula deltas should be smaller.
- **Root cause hypothesis (not yet confirmed):** AstroSage may use a different obliquity constant or apply a soft cap below 60 Virupa for high-declination cases. PyJHora's calibrated constant (24.0) matches Sun within 0.30 but diverges for outer planets at extreme declination.

### Shadbala Drik Bala (V1 stub)
- **Spec source:** BPHS 27.26. PyJHora `__drik_bala_calc_1` kernel ported and tested as primary implementation path.
- **AstroSage/JHora delta:** Port matched AstroSage within ±5 Virupa for Surbhi (7/7 planets) but diverged on Sulabh Moon (+16.4) and Venus (+7.7), despite AstroSage and JHora agreeing closely with each other on those exact two values. Root cause unresolved after two kernel variants and two Moon benefic/malefic classification approaches tested across sessions 36-37.
- **Resolution:** Stubbed at 0.0 for all planets in V1. shadbala_totals.py (P2.5.7) exposes this via a mandatory `drik_is_stubbed: bool` and `caveat: str` field on every planet's output — not optional, not silent.
- **User impact:** Shadbala totals understated by the true Drik Bala magnitude per planet (AstroSage fixture range observed: -20.44 to +22.15 Virupa). Ratio (Rupas/minimum) may read "above minimum" when the true ratio is below. Rank order usually preserved but not guaranteed within ~20 Virupa.
- **Revisit trigger:** New source material only — AstroSage's published Drik Bala formula (not currently public) or the untested PyJHora `__drik_bala_calc_1_pvr` kernel variant. DO NOT re-attempt by fitting parameters against fixture output (rejected pattern, see session 36-37 history) — only fresh hypothesis testing.

### Shadbala Kala Bala — Sun cross-chart Abda/Masa divergence
- **Spec source:** BPHS 27.7-13 (Abda/Masa/Vara/Hora Bala — calendar-lord assignment by solar month/day ingress).
- **AstroSage delta:** Sulabh Sun kala_total validated within ±2 Virupa, but Surbhi chart showed Jupiter +31 and Saturn -59 Virupa divergence, traced to Abda=15/Masa=0 vs computed Abda=0/Masa=0 — a solar-month ingress date disagreement between BPHS calendar-lord assignment and AstroSage's algorithm. Surfaced during P2.5.7 totals testing (test_shadbala_totals.py Layer B); kala_bala.py itself was never tested against Surbhi at this granularity.
- **User impact:** Limited to Sun kala_total cross-chart comparisons; does not affect Sulabh (the primary validated chart) or other planets.
- **Revisit trigger:** If P3 Yoga detection or P7 trigger-naming surfaces a ranking anomaly traceable to Sun kala_total on a non-Sulabh chart. Not re-opened proactively — within the 2-diagnostic-attempt budget, this is deprioritized behind Drik Bala and P3.
